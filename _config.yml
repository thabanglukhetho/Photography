 bio: "Welcome to the master photography ThabangLukhetho's gallery. I'm based in South Africa from the most diverse township called Soshanguve, I'm a self-taught visual artist and enjoy capturing moments. It started with a 1 megapixel Nokia phone in 2017 and from there it has been nothing but a journey of discovery and adventure. My interest ranges from a documentary, street, abstract to nature photography. Feel free to pop me a message for anything photography-related. For high-quality printouts please DM on my socials or an email me at thabangvision@gmail.com. We provide shipment worldwide."
